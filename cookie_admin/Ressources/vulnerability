When inspecting the cookies we found one named `I_am_admin`, so we can easily understand that is a variable to define if the user have admin rights.

This is a big vulnerability because a cookie shouldn't be trusted by a server, it's only for store data on a period.

The value is encoded is a MD5 hash (68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327) that means false.

So we just have to encode `true` (b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09) and replace the value of the cookie to get admin access.
