This vulnerability is known as Unrestricted File Upload.

It's a high risk because when a user can upload any file on the server, this could be used as a backdoor to gain admin accesses, private data...

In this case we can fake the Content-Type of the file uploaded and it seems that the file validation on the server is only based on this header.
